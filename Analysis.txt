The Profile folder contains the Procfile file:
Hereâ€™s what each part means:

- web: tells the platform (like Heroku) to run this as a web process.

- gunicorn: is a Python WSGI HTTP server used in production (you need to add it to requirements.txt).

- app:app means:

the file is app.py and inside it, your Flask instance is named app.

You can edit the form display as you want e.g. HTML, CSS

Don't worry about the .gitignore file, it only bypasses the git refferences
